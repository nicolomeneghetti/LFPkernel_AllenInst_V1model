This folder contains two types of codes. 

The codes starting with "estimate_kernels_single_layer_L23 ..." contain the intructions necessary to estimate the LFP-kernels associated with the single-layer L23 Allen V1 model. One code is relative to the kernels associated with the presentation of gratings stimuli; the second one with the presentation of flash stimuli. 

The resulting kernels relative to the single-L23 model are presented in the folders: (1) gratings_kernels; (2) kernels_flashes

---------------------------------------

The codes starting with "from_kernels_to_LFPs_ ..." contain the intructions necessary to estimate the LFPs using the LFP-kernels estimated in the previous step. It also contains the instrictions to plot the comparison between kernel-based LFP and the LFP estimated with MC simulations using the bmtk simulator. 

The resulting LFPs signals are contained in the folder "from kernels to LFPs"
