This folder contains the LFPs estimated with (1) the kernels and (2) multicompartmental simulations using the bmtk simulator. 

The two folders (divided according to the two types of stimuli adopted) contains: 

'LFPs_487661754_e23Cux2' -> contains the LFP estimated with the LFP-kernels; 
'LFPs_Allen_Inst_single_layer_e23Cux2' -> contains the LFP estimated with MC simulations
