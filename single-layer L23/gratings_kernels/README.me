This folder conains the kernels corresponding to the single-layer L23 V1 model. The V1 model was presented with contrast drifting gratings. 

The file "vector_time_normalized_levels" contains an array indicating, for each time point, which kernels should be used. In our scenario we used two types of kernels, corresponding to the two discrete levels in which the leak conductance change throughout time was discretized. 

The folder 'e23Cux2'... contains the actual kernels. You'll notice it has two subfolders, named '0' and '1': this subfolders indicate the two types of kernels mentioned above.
